# ISBN_search

A Python script for scanning ISBNs (barcodes) to check if the book is already listed in our webshop.

Main.py runs the program. 

Updates listed online products to a local SQLite database daily. Scanned ISBN-barcodes are compared to this list. 
Allows scanning even if the database cannot be updated.
